# Background Changer (React)

A small React app that lets you change the background of a web page — colors, gradients, or images — for learning and demonstration purposes.

## Features

- Change background color using a color picker
- Apply linear gradients with multiple color stops
- Upload and set a background image
- Copy CSS for the current background
- Simple, dependency-light React codebase intended for learning

## Demo

Open the app in your browser after running locally (instructions below) to interactively change the page background.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 16
- npm or yarn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aniketmmaind/bgchanger_react.git
cd bgchanger_react
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
# yarn
```

## Running locally

Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
# or
# yarn start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 (or the address shown in the terminal).

## Building for production

```bash
npm run build
# or
# yarn build
```

The optimized build will be in the `build/` folder and is ready to deploy to static hosts.

## Project structure (high level)
